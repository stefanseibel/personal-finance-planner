# Personal Finance Planner

### Project
My Personal Finance Planner is a Web-App (other Platforms might follow in the future) to manage one's monthly budget, track wealth and plan for the future!

### Technologies
At whole: "**SERN** Stack" (SQL/Express.js/React.js/Node.js)

 - **Frontend**: React.js, Typescript, Material Design
 - **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Javascript
 - **Database**: SQL, MySQL
 
### Git

Each Commit must start with "*type*/*project*/*part*"
- **Type** is the type of work done (add,fix,misc,...)
- **Project** is the project where the work is done (front,back,...)
- **Part** is the part of the project worked on (front/budget, back/auth, ...) (optional when not applicable)

This is followed by a description of the commit

Branches might be utilized in the future when work on both the frontend and backend is in progress, or complexity requires it, however **unnessecary in the beginning**
